# The Motion Manager for generating upper-limb motion in humanoid robots 
This is the the Motion Manager. This software is meant to contain several movement planners, a movement learner and a movement controller. The communication is managed by ROS and for this reason it is meant as a ROS package.  

Currently supported robots:
* the **A**nthropomorphic **Ro**botic **S**ystem **ARoS**: see its [URDF model](https://github.com/zohannn/aros_description)
